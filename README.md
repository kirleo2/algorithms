# algorithms
- My program implements algorithms with visualization, including A*, BFS, DFS, Random Search, and Greedy Search. Each algorithm is designed to solve a specific type of problem.

- The A* algorithm is a heuristic search algorithm that is commonly used in pathfinding and graph traversal. It is a combination of Dijkstra's algorithm and a heuristic estimate of the distance to the goal.

- The BFS (breadth-first search) algorithm is a search strategy that explores all the vertices at the current depth level before moving on to the next depth level. This algorithm is useful for finding the shortest path between two points in an unweighted graph.

- The DFS (depth-first search) algorithm is another search strategy that explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. This algorithm is often used to find connected components in a graph.

- Random Search is a brute-force search algorithm that randomly selects a candidate solution from a large search space. Although this algorithm is not efficient, it can be useful for finding solutions in situations where there is no known structure to the problem.

- The Greedy Search algorithm is a search strategy that always chooses the most promising option at each step. This algorithm is useful when the goal is to find a quick and simple solution, even if it may not be the optimal one.

- In my program, each algorithm is implemented with visualization, allowing the user to see the algorithm in action and better understand how it works.
